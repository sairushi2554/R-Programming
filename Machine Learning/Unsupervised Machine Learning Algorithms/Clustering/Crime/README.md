# Crime Data Clustering

This repository contains the code and analysis for performing clustering on a crime dataset from the United States. The goal of the analysis is to identify patterns and groupings of regions based on various crime and demographic factors, helping to uncover insights into the crime landscape across different areas.

## Problem Statement

The task is to perform clustering on a crime dataset and identify the number of clusters formed. The primary objective is to analyze crime rates in different regions of the United States, and based on these rates, group the regions into clusters. After clustering, draw inferences regarding the crime patterns and factors that contribute to these clusters.

### Key Steps:
- Perform clustering using appropriate algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualize the clusters and analyze the results.
- Draw inferences based on the characteristics of each cluster.

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

1. **Murder**: Murder rates across various regions of the United States.
2. **Assault**: Assault rates across various regions of the United States.
3. **UrbanPop**: Urban population percentage in different regions of the United States.
4. **Rape**: Rape rates in various regions of the United States.

The data is structured to allow analysis of crime rates alongside demographic factors such as urban population, providing valuable insights into how crime correlates with population density and other factors.

## Objectives

- **Clustering**: Group similar regions based on their crime rates and urbanization.
- **Visualization**: Provide visual representations of the clusters formed, such as scatter plots or pairwise comparisons.
- **Inferences**: Identify patterns within each cluster (e.g., regions with high crime rates, urban vs. rural crime rates).
- **Insights**: Explore how demographic factors like urban population influence crime rates.
